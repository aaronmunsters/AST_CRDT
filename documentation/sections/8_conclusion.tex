\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This work covers an alternative strategy to implement a real-time collaborative code editor to overcome the limitations
that arise for traditional editors that do not reason about their content.
It does so by modeling the underlying AST as a conflict-free replicated data type.
The implementation covers a minimal set of nodes, demonstrating the capability of the merging strategy to resolve
conflicts for different concurrent operations.
The strategy is mainly based on the inclusion of a logical timestamp allowing for an ordering of events that allows the
data structure to recompute the AST including newly received updates.
Even so, certain optimizations are in order to improve the conflict resolution, either by inclusion of developer-roles
or by shifting the merge granularity.
