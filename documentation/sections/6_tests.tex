For the given test suite, the IntelliJ Test Coverage Tool reports 100\% code coverage\footnote{
    Note that to view this code coverage report, the IntelliJ feature to export code coverage to an HTML format was used,
    which shows that the sole methods that are not covered are the generated macro's originating from the pickling library
    to serialize the operations.} for the scala code, except the entry point for the JavaScript environment as this consist
of 40 lines of JavaScript bindings.
This broad testing suite paired with the high amount of code coverage aims to demonstrate the effort in verifying the
correctness of the codebase.

An integration test that covers the case in which different operations reach replica's in different orders is present in
the \mintinline{scala}{"Test the replicated ASTs"} test that is present in the
\mintinline{scala}{ConflictFreeReplicatedIntAstTest} class.
A snippet of this test is reported in Listing~\ref{code:tests-asserting-commute}.
This listing shows how the iteration through the powerset of a set of operations applied to a newly constructed AST,
both in ordered and randomly shuffled order, results in isomorphic outcome ASTs.

\begin{listing}
    \begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{scala}
for (subset <- operations.subsets()) {
    val ordered = new ConflictFreeReplicatedAst()
    val shuffled = new ConflictFreeReplicatedAst()

    val operations = subset.toSeq

    ordered merge operations
    shuffled merge rnd.shuffle(operations)
    assert(ordered.query isomorphic shuffled.query)
}
    \end{minted}
    \caption{
        A snippet of the tests (with technical details left out) that takes a set of operations, iterates through the
        powerset of these operations (thus taking into account operations that are temporarily out of order) and asserts
        that the application of both the ordered and the shuffled sequence of operations to an empty AST results in
        isomorphic ASTs.
