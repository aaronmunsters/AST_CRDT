# Documentation
This is the documentation.
The documentation is written in LaTeX and compiled locally.

To compile this document yourself, please ensure the following is installed:
* [Texlive](https://tug.org/texlive/) (to run pdflatex)
* [Pygments](https://pygments.org/)
* [Drawio-desktop](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop)
* [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)
* [tee](https://www.unix.com/man-page/posix/1posix/tee/)

If so, then a simple `make` command should compile the images, run the tests, compile the text and output the pdf.
